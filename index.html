                <p>Hello, my name is William and I currently reside in Grand Rapids! I've had an interest in coding since a young age, but having always been on the move I've always found it difficult to learn. Now that I'm a bit older and settled I'm attending class online at We Can Code IT thanks to Amazon career services.</p>
                <p>As well as coding I have an interest in Photography and travel, I picked up my first real camera when I lived in Alaska which was the 6th out of 9 states I've lived in. It was a Mirror-less Panasonic GH-4 and I still have it to this day! While I'm an amateur photographer who mostly does landscape work. I have a huge passion for night photography and the challenge that comes with it. You can also occasionally catch me doing city shots or even attempting my hand at astrophotography.</p>
