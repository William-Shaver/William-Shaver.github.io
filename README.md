My Portfolio
05/20/2023 Alright so I need to do a better job at keeping this up to date. So far I have:
    Formatted the document
    Started the  
    Created a div container named aboutContainer
    aboutContainer so far has a bio, image, skills, githb and indeed link and practice but non-functional form.
 6/1/23 6 hours after doing "a couple quick things" it is looking a lot more refined. I went through and more finely adjusted padding/margin,
 created grids and 2 small flex containers among a lot of other things.
